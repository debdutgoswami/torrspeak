## Inspiration
Being an avid hackathonista, we need to stay awake for nights during hackathons while we figure out things, or do some sort of research on the web. Most of the time we use Medium or other popular tech blogs to study important topics and during that, we need to take notes on certain points on the same. While we use Zoom or Meet or any other apps to do live streaming and discussion, sometimes network issues might reduce the user experience & ultimately kill during that long hour of brainstorming. **Certainly taking up notes physically & keeping a track of notes during that is a big hassle & makes stuff very untidy!**

Don't fear, when 𝐓𝐨𝐫𝐫𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐚𝐤 is here! 

## What it does
𝐓𝐨𝐫𝐫𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐚𝐤 helps keep your notes data *neat and clean*. Write comments/reviews at different places on a webpage. Provides co-ordinated reply to your friends' comments. See what part of the content your friends are interacting with. After the discussion is over, users lying in their respective rooms, can download the whole convo as a full-page screenshot for later access! It's being run on Linode for faster & seamless access! 

## How we built it
Pronounce is crafted with ❤️. It's built on Reactjs. The backend is running on Flask. It's integrated with Firestore for data storage and web-sockets to communicate between the two. Last but not the least, it's deployed on Linode, so that it can be accessed by people around the world for free, forever across both PC or mobile!

## Challenges we ran into
This is the 1st time we have used Linode in our project. Being a novice, we took a lot of time configuring it. Also, it was a bit difficult for us to collaborate in a virtual setting but we somehow managed to finish the project on time. :)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of finishing the project on time, which seemed like a tough task initially but happily were also able to add most of the features that we envisioned for the app during ideation.

## What we learned
A lot of things regarding Linode, backend configuration, and other non-technical stuff. Most importantly, we realized that proper sleep is very important! :p

## What's next for Torrspeak
Finish the unfinished ones. We had a lot of other ideas like integrating separate collaborator canvas and adding security measures into the project, which we are planning to integrate into this project after the hackathon is over.
